# Unpackager

https://turbowarp.github.io/unpackager/

Extract the original Scratch project from HTML or zip files generated by the TurboWarp Packager, the forkphorus packager, or HTMLifier.

The unpackager is developed as a simple static website. There is no build step. index.html is the website and unpackager.js is the core unpackaging logic. Library dependencies are manually vendored in the dependencies folder.

Unpackager is licensed under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0, just like the TurboWarp Packager.
